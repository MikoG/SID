# SID

SID is the Simple Indie Game Development Kit for C++. It is currently being developed for Linux but with extensive use of the SDL2 libraries there is scope to move into other platforms.

SID aims to provide developers with a framework for implementing menu systems and tile based 3d world to stage their game in.

SID is in its early development phase and still needs a lot of work before anything meaningful can be made out of it. An example game, Children of Orion, is being developed in tandem with SID and can be found in my COO repo.
